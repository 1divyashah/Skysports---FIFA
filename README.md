This project involves importing two CSV files into a database named `Sky_Sports` in DBeaver and performing a series of SQL queries to analyze and extract various statistics from the data. The database comprises two tables: `skysports_table1` and `sky_sports_table2`.

Key steps and objectives:

1. Data Import and Setup:
   - Import two CSV files into the `Sky_Sports` database, creating tables `skysports_table1` and `sky_sports_table2`.
   
2. Basic Queries:
   - Retrieve and display data from both tables.
   - Show unique team names.
   - Identify teams based on specific criteria like rank and group.

3. Aggregation and Statistical Queries:
   - Count total teams.
   - Display matches played, percentage of wins, draws, and losses for each team.
   - Identify teams with maximum and minimum goals scored.
   - Calculate average goal difference and possession.

4. Filtering and Conditional Queries:
   - Show data for teams with zero points, and those having played a certain number of games.
   - Display data for teams with specific criteria like minutes played, errors, and touches.

5. Advanced Analytical Queries:
   - Calculate average and sum of various metrics grouped by team and group.
   - Show statistics in ascending or descending order based on different performance metrics like goals per 90 minutes, shots, passes percentage, etc.

6. Join and Group By Operations:
   - Combine data from both tables to extract insights about groups, such as average age, total fouls, games played, players used, and other performance metrics.

SQL Query Highlights:
- Unique Teams: Extract all unique team names.
- Top Teams: Identify top-ranked teams from specific groups.
- Count and Percentages: Calculate count of teams and percentages for wins, draws, and losses.
- Max/Min Values: Find teams with maximum and minimum goals scored.
- Group Statistics: Summarize and order data based on group performance in different aspects like goals, expected goals, and fouls.

By executing these queries, comprehensive insights into team performances, group statistics, and individual metrics are obtained, enabling detailed analysis and reporting for Sky Sports data.
